# HKA KI-Lab SS23 Group MindCraft

This Repository accompanies the project phase of the KI-Lab.

## Data

The data must be saved in the data folder. The data is available here https://raganato.github.io/vwsd/. The datatsets for train and trial can be simply downloaded and extracted. For the test data we choose to use the resized dataset. Therefore extracted test images must be saved to ./data/test_images_resized/, while the gold labels directly reside in the ./data/ folder.
